# Weather-App

A simple weather detecting app that i built using vanilla javascript with minimal styling.

### Api used 
`https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/`

I used the `HTML5 geolocation API` along with a get request to the freeCodeCamp's weather API to get the current temperature and climate of the users location if Location access is given by the user.
The Weather-Api is a little buggy in that it shows the incorrect location at first sometimes but reloading the page solves the issue.
